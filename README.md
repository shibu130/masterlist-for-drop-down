# masterlist-for-drop-down
Here u can find Masterlist for country city state ,education,visa type



well i did a lot of copy paste went to each embassy site to get the types of visa each country provides



while education master list was easy ,less copy paste but it lacks lot of data


Country city state well 3 tables to 40 k tables because u will have to use lots of processing power to select based on id

i made it simple select country from countries table u have that countries table with states and then seperate table for each state containing cities 


Well you may find this useful while doing a project which has a registration page , I used to search for getting the type of visa for each country i couldnt find one so i went to each and every embassy website to compile a list


I hope someone someday will find this useful
