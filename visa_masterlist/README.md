so we have a text file here

which has a structure

  country
  {
   entry1
   entry2
  }
   country2
   {
     .....
     ....
   }


So the python script will read this file and insert into a table called visatypes 

the structure of table will be like



id ||  country ||  visa ||



well someone may ask why not create an export dump of the sql table of inutial 3 tables ,well i had the table dump but somehow lost it 





Also change the db and username and the ip in the script 


So a question arises why create this?
------------------------------------

Well i couldnt find the information or a db dump containing visa details so i created one myself by searching many sites and putting them together into a file
