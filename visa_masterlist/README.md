so we have a text file here

which has a structure

  country
  {
   entry1
   entry2
  }
   country2
   {
     .....
     ....
   }


So the python script will read this file and insert into a table called visatypes 

the structure of table will be like



id ||  country ||  visa ||



well someone may ask why not create an export dump of the sql table ,well i had the table dump but somehow lost it and i found the script recently
